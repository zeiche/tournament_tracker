Implement working inbound/outbound calling for tournament tracker

- Successfully configured inbound calling on port 8082
- Created multiple handlers (inbound_safe.py, voice_chat_server.py, etc)
- Integrated Twilio voice with polymorphic query system
- Added DTMF menu navigation for tournament info
- Configured voice personalities (alice, brian, matthew)
- Fixed Dreamhost firewall issue by opening port 8082
- Outbound calls work with TwiML for tournament announcements
- Inbound calls receive interactive menu with tournament data

The system now supports full bidirectional voice communication!
Users can call +18788794283 to hear tournament info via menu.
We can also call users with tournament updates.

Note: The rickroll Easter egg remains as fallback :)
