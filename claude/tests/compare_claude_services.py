    print("""
1. ZERO CONFIGURATION UPDATES
   ‚Ä¢ New services work immediately
   ‚Ä¢ No Claude code changes needed
   ‚Ä¢ Services self-describe their capabilities

2. REAL-TIME ADAPTATION
   ‚Ä¢ Claude knows what's currently running
   ‚Ä¢ Capabilities change with system state
   ‚Ä¢ Can explain when services are unavailable

3. NATURAL CONVERSATION FLOW
   ‚Ä¢ Services speak natural language (ask/tell/do)
   ‚Ä¢ Claude routes based on intent, not syntax
   ‚Ä¢ Enables service-to-service conversations

4. DISCOVERABILITY
   ‚Ä¢ Users can ask "what can you do?"
   ‚Ä¢ Response changes based on running services
   ‚Ä¢ Claude can explain each service's capabilities

5. RESILIENCE
   ‚Ä¢ If a service stops, Claude knows immediately
   ‚Ä¢ Can suggest alternatives or explain what's missing
   ‚Ä¢ Gracefully handles service failures

To fully leverage Bonjour-enhanced Claude:

1. Keep both services during transition:
   ‚Ä¢ claude_service.py for existing integrations
   ‚Ä¢ claude_bonjour_service.py for new capabilities

2. Update Discord bot to use new service:
   ‚Ä¢ Import claude_bonjour instead of claude_service
   ‚Ä¢ Use ask_with_discovery() method

3. Services should announce themselves:
   ‚Ä¢ Add announcer.announce() to all services
   ‚Ä¢ Include natural language descriptions
   ‚Ä¢ Provide usage examples

4. Eventually deprecate old Claude service:
   ‚Ä¢ Once all integrations updated
   ‚Ä¢ When all services announce properly
   ‚Ä¢ After testing in production
