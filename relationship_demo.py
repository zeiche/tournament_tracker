The new OOP models enable:

1. TEMPORAL INTELLIGENCE
   - Tournaments understand their time context
   - Built-in seasonal, quarterly, monthly analysis
   - Relative time calculations (is_recent, time_ago)

2. GEOGRAPHIC AWARENESS
   - All location-based objects can calculate distances
   - Region filtering and geographic clustering
   - Coordinate-based relationships

3. ANALYTICAL METHODS
   - Competition level assessment
   - Automatic weight calculations for visualizations
   - Performance metrics built into objects

4. NETWORK RELATIONSHIPS
   - Players track their geographic footprint
   - Organizations understand their venue network
   - Cross-object relationship traversal

These weren't just difficult before - they were IMPOSSIBLE with
the old flat, C-style data model. Now every object is intelligent
and understands its context in the tournament ecosystem!
