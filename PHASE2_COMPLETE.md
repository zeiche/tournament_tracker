- Built-in commands: ping, help, status

## ðŸ”§ Infrastructure Updates

### Service Locator Updated âœ…
**File:** `polymorphic_core/service_locator.py`

**Changes:**
- Added Phase 2 refactored services as defaults
- Legacy services available as fallback (`claude_legacy`, etc.)
- Clear organization: Phase 1 (Core), Phase 2 (Business), Phase 3+ (Remaining)

### Switch Announcements âœ…
All Phase 2 services now announce themselves as switches for `go.py`:
- `--ai` â†’ Claude CLI Service (Refactored)
- `--web` â†’ Web Editor Service (Refactored)  
- `--interactive` â†’ Interactive Service (Refactored)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements

### 1. Complete Business Layer Transparency
- AI processing works with local OR network services
- Web admin adapts to any discovered services
- Interactive REPL uses discovered database/Claude
- Message handling automatically routes to best available service

### 2. Zero Breaking Changes
- All existing function calls still work
- Same interfaces and return values
- Go.py switches work exactly the same
- Backward compatibility maintained 100%

### 3. Enhanced Capabilities
- All services support natural language queries via ask/tell/do
- Comprehensive statistics and monitoring
- Automatic service health checking
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. True Distributed Architecture
- Any service can run on different machines
- Automatic service discovery via mDNS
- Network-accessible HTTP endpoints where appropriate
- Centralized logging and error handling

## ðŸ“Š Before vs After Comparison

### Before (Direct Dependencies)
```python
# Claude CLI Service
from utils.error_handler import handle_errors, handle_exception
from utils.simple_logger import info, warning, error

# Web Editor  
from utils.simple_logger import info, warning, error
from utils.error_handler import handle_errors

# Interactive Service
from database import init_database, get_session
from claude_cli_service import claude_cli

# Message Handler
from search.polymorphic_queries import query as pq
```

### After (Service Locator)
```python
# All services now use:
from polymorphic_core.service_locator import get_service

class RefactoredService:
    def __init__(self, prefer_network=False):
        self.prefer_network = prefer_network
        self._database = None
        self._claude = None
        self._logger = None
    
    @property
    def database(self):
        if self._database is None:
            self._database = get_service("database", self.prefer_network)
        return self._database
    
    # Same pattern for all dependencies
```

**Benefits:**
- Works with local OR network services
- Zero configuration required  
- Automatic fallback and discovery
- Can be distributed across machines

## ðŸš€ New Capabilities Unlocked

### 1. Distributed AI Processing
Claude CLI service can now run on dedicated AI machines while other services use it transparently.

### 2. Centralized Web Administration
Web editor can discover and manage services across multiple machines via mDNS.

### 3. Remote Interactive Sessions
REPL can connect to database and AI services running anywhere on the network.

### 4. Scalable Message Processing
Message handler can route to the best available services automatically.

### 5. Network Service Discovery
All services automatically find each other via mDNS - no configuration needed.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Cross-Service Communication âœ…
- All Phase 2 services successfully use Phase 1 core services via service locator
- Local and network service access works identically
- Automatic fallback between local and network services verified

### Performance âœ…
- Service locator overhead minimal due to caching
- No significant performance impact on business operations
- Lazy loading prevents unnecessary service initialization

### Backward Compatibility âœ…
- All existing go.py commands work unchanged
- All function interfaces preserved
- Zero migration required for existing workflows

## ðŸ“‹ Architecture Pattern Established

The refactoring establishes the clear pattern for all remaining services:

### 1. Service Dependencies
```python
@property
def service_name(self):
    if self._service_name is None:
        self._service_name = get_service("service_name", self.prefer_network)
    return self._service_name
```

### 2. Enhanced Interface
```python
def ask(self, query: str, **kwargs) -> Any:
    """Natural language queries"""
    
def tell(self, format_type: str, data: Any = None, **kwargs) -> str:
    """Format output for any destination"""
    
def do(self, action: str, **kwargs) -> Any:
    """Perform operations via natural language"""
```

### 3. Service Announcements
```python
announcer.announce(
    "Service Name (Refactored)",
    ["Enhanced capabilities", "Location transparency"],
    ["service.ask('example')", "service.do('example action')"]
)
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Phase 2: Mission Accomplished!

âœ… **Claude CLI Service** - Distributed AI processing with queue management  
âœ… **Web Editor Service** - Universal admin interface with mDNS discovery  
âœ… **Interactive Service** - REPL with service locator integration  
âœ… **Message Handler** - Smart message routing with automatic fallback  

## ðŸ“ˆ Total Progress: 8/8 Major Services Refactored

### Phase 1 (Core Services) âœ…
- Database Service
- Logger Service  
- Error Handler
- Config Service

### Phase 2 (Business Services) âœ…
- Claude CLI Service
- Web Editor Service
- Interactive Service
- Message Handler

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Means

The entire core architecture of the tournament tracker now operates with **true location transparency**. Any service can discover and use any other service without knowing whether it's a local Python import or a remote network service discovered via mDNS.

### For Development:
- Test with local services, deploy with network services, same code
- Easy to scale individual services to dedicated machines
- Zero configuration service discovery

### For Deployment:
- Services can be distributed across multiple machines
- Automatic load balancing via service discovery
- Fault tolerance with automatic fallback

### For Maintenance:
- All services follow the same 3-method pattern
- Consistent logging and error handling across all services
- Enhanced monitoring and debugging capabilities

**Next Steps:** Phase 3+ will continue with remaining specialized services (sync, twilio, etc.) using the same proven pattern. The foundation for a truly distributed, self-discovering architecture is now complete!
