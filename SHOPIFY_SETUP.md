# Shopify Integration Status

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Connection Established** - Your Shopify store is connected and accessible
- Store: BACKYARD TRY-HARDS üò§
- Domain: backyardtryhards.com
- Shopify Domain: 8ccd49-4.myshopify.com

## Issue Found
‚ùå **Insufficient API Permissions** - The current access token lacks required scopes

### Required Actions  
The access token needs additional permissions to publish content.

Current errors:
- `read_content` scope required for Pages  
- `read_products` scope required for Products
- Write permissions also needed for publishing

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Update Access Token Permissions (Recommended)
1. Log into your Shopify admin at https://8ccd49-4.myshopify.com/admin
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Apps and sales channels** ‚Üí **Develop apps**
3. Find your app or create a new one
4. In **API credentials**, configure these scopes:
   - **Admin API access scopes**:
     - `write_content` (for Pages)
     - `read_content` 
     - `write_products` (for Products)
     - `read_products`
5. Install the app to your store
6. Copy the new access token
7. Update `.env` file with new token

### Option 2: Use Storefront API
If you only need to display data (not create/update), consider using the Storefront API which has different permission requirements.

### Option 3: Manual Publishing
For now, you can:
1. Generate reports locally using `./go.py --html report.html`
2. Copy the content manually to Shopify admin
3. Create pages/products through the Shopify interface

## Tournament Data Ready
Your tournament data is synchronized and ready:
- 495 tournaments processed
- Organizations identified
- Rankings calculated

Once permissions are fixed, you can publish with:
```bash
./go.py --publish
```

## Files Created
- `shopify_tournament_data.json` - Raw tournament data
- `shopify_tournament_rankings.html` - Formatted HTML report
- `test_shopify_output.html` - Test output

## Next Steps
1. Update the Shopify access token with proper permissions
2. Test with: `python3 shopify_service.py --test`
3. Publish with: `./go.py --publish`
