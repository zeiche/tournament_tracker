## Current State (2025-09-01)

### What We're Working On
Fixing tournament organization names that appear as emails/Discord links instead of proper names.

### Services Running
- **Web Editor**: Dynamic port via Bonjour discovery (Database management UI)
- **Dynamic Proxy**: Port 8000 (SSL subdomain routing)
- **Nginx SSL**: Port 443 (External HTTPS access)

### Main Problem
Tournaments are identified by contact info (email/Discord) instead of organization names:
- Current: "tryhardsbackyard@gmail.com" 
- Should be: "BACKYARD TRY-HARDS"

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check current state
./go.py --console

# Fix via web UI  
lynx editor.zilogo.com

# View logs
tail -f web_editor.log

# Restart services
./go.py --restart-services
```

### Recent Changes
- Created web_editor.py to replace broken curses TUI
- Set up webhook server with systemd
- Fixed disk space issues
- Installed Python dependencies via apt

### Files I Should Know About
- `go.py` - Main entry point
- `web_editor.py` - Web UI for fixing org names (we created this)
- `startgg_sync.py` - Source of the naming problem
- `tournament_tracker.db` - SQLite database
- `QUICKFIX.md` - How to fix the org names
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design details

### User Environment
- Platform: Ubuntu on VPS
- Access: iPad via Termius SSH
- Can't use curses/TUI (SSH limitations)
- Using lynx for web browsing
- No port forwarding in Termius (needs Pro)

### Next Time
If asked to continue, focus on:
1. Fixing organization names via web UI or SQL
2. Updating sync logic to prevent future issues
3. Adding proper org name validation
