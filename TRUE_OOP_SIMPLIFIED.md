# TRUE OOP: The Simplified Version

## You're RIGHT - Too Many Methods is Still C-Thinking!

### The Problem with 200+ Methods
That's just C-style functions stuffed into a class! 

### The TRUE OOP Way: Just a Few POWERFUL Methods

```python
class Tournament(Base):
    """Tournament with just a FEW powerful methods"""
    
    def query(self, what: str, session):
        """
        One method to query ANYTHING about this tournament.
        Polymorphic - figures out what you want.
        """
        if "winner" in what.lower():
            return self.standings.filter_by(placement=1).first()
        elif "top" in what.lower():
            return self.standings.order_by(Standing.placement).limit(8).all()
        elif "attendance" in what.lower():
            return self.num_attendees
        # ... etc - ONE method, many capabilities
    
    def explain(self, to_whom: str = "claude"):
        """
        One method to explain itself to anyone.
        """
        if to_whom == "claude":
            return self._claude_explanation()
        elif to_whom == "discord":
            return self._discord_format()
        elif to_whom == "human":
            return self._human_readable()
        else:
            return str(self)
    
    def do(self, action: str, **kwargs):
        """
        One method to DO anything.
        """
        if action == "sync":
            return self._sync_from_api()
        elif action == "calculate":
            return self._calculate_stats()
        elif action == "announce":
            return self._announce_capabilities()
        # ONE method, polymorphic behavior
```

## The REAL Power: Maybe Just THREE Methods?

```python
class SmartModel:
    """ALL models just need these THREE methods"""
    
    def ask(self, question: Any) -> Any:
        """
        Ask the object ANYTHING.
        It figures out what you want.
        """
        # Polymorphic - accepts any question format
        # Returns appropriate answer
        pass
    
    def tell(self, format: str = "default") -> str:
        """
        Tell about yourself in any format.
        """
        # Polymorphic formatting
        pass
    
    def do(self, what: Any, **context) -> Any:
        """
        Do anything that needs doing.
        """
        # Polymorphic action handler
        pass
```

## That's IT!

Every object just needs:
1. **ask()** - Answer any question about itself
2. **tell()** - Explain itself in any format  
3. **do()** - Perform any action

## Examples:

```python
# Instead of 200 methods:
tournament.ask("who won")          # Returns winner
tournament.ask("top 8")            # Returns top 8
tournament.ask("attendance")       # Returns number
tournament.tell("discord")         # Formats for Discord
tournament.tell("claude")          # Explains to Claude
tournament.do("sync")              # Syncs from API
tournament.do("calculate stats")   # Calculates everything

# Player too:
player.ask("recent tournaments")   # Returns recent events
player.ask("win rate")            # Returns percentage
player.tell("claude")              # Explains capabilities
player.do("update stats")         # Updates everything
```

## The Beauty:

- **3 methods instead of 200+**
- **Truly polymorphic** - Methods figure out intent
- **Self-discovering** - Objects determine what's being asked
- **No documentation needed** - Just ask()!

## This is DRINKING THE KOOL-AID!

Not 200 specific methods (that's still C-thinking).
Just 3 POWERFUL polymorphic methods that handle EVERYTHING!
