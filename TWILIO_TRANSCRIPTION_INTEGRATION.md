# Twilio Transcription Integration - Complete

## Overview

Successfully integrated Twilio media streaming with the polymorphic transcription system. The integration provides real-time voice transcription for phone calls using offline Vosk speech recognition with built-in silence detection.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **TwiML Stream Server** (`twiml_stream_server.py`)
   - Port: 8086
   - Provides TwiML responses for Twilio webhooks
   - Returns `<Stream>` directives pointing to WebSocket server
   - Endpoint: `/voice-stream.xml`

2. **Polymorphic Stream Server** (`twilio_stream_polymorphic.py`)
   - Port: 8088 (WebSocket)
   - Handles Twilio Media Stream WebSocket connections
   - Receives mulaw audio from Twilio
   - Integrates with transcription bridge

3. **Transcription Bridge** (`twilio_transcription_bridge.py`)
   - Connects Twilio streams to polymorphic transcription system
   - Manages handler registration for active calls
   - Processes transcription results and generates responses
   - Routes responses back to Twilio callers

4. **Polymorphic Transcription Service** (`polymorphic_core/audio/transcription.py`)
   - Offline Vosk speech recognition
   - Built-in voice activity detection
   - Silence threshold filtering
   - Announces results via Bonjour system

## Data Flow

```
Twilio Call → TwiML Server → WebSocket Stream → Transcription Bridge
                ↓                                      ↓
            Stream Response                  Polymorphic Transcription
                ↑                                      ↓
            TTS Response ← Tournament Query ← Transcription Result
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Incoming Call**: Twilio calls `/voice-stream.xml` endpoint
2. **TwiML Response**: Returns `<Stream url="wss://0-page.com:8088/">` 
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Twilio connects to polymorphic stream server
4. **Stream Registration**: Call registered with transcription bridge
5. **Audio Processing**: 
   - Receives mulaw audio chunks from Twilio
   - Accumulates ~2 seconds of audio
   - Sends to transcription bridge
6. **Transcription**:
   - Bridge forwards to polymorphic transcription service
   - Vosk processes audio with silence detection
   - Results announced via Bonjour
7. **Response Generation**:
   - Bridge queries tournament system with transcription
   - Generates natural language response
   - Sends TTS audio back to caller

## Configuration

### Ports
- **8086**: TwiML HTTP server (Flask)
- **8088**: WebSocket stream server (secure)

### WebSocket URL
- Production: `wss://0-page.com:8088/`
- SSL certificates required for secure connection

## Usage

### Starting the System
```bash
./go.py --twilio-transcription
```

This command starts all three components:
1. TwiML server on port 8086
2. Transcription bridge process
3. Polymorphic stream server on port 8088

### TwiML Integration
Configure Twilio webhook URL to point to:
```
https://your-domain.com:8086/voice-stream.xml
```

### Example Voice Interactions

**Caller**: "Show me player west"
**System**: "West has 45 tournament wins and is currently ranked first place with a win rate of 78%."

**Caller**: "What are recent tournaments?"
**System**: "The latest major tournament was West Coast Warzone with 256 players held last weekend in Los Angeles."

**Caller**: "Hello"
**System**: "Hello! I'm the Try Hard Tournament Tracker. Ask me about tournaments, players, or rankings."

## Technical Features

### Polymorphic Integration
- Uses Bonjour-style service discovery
- Integrates with existing transcription infrastructure
- Leverages polymorphic query system
- Follows ask/tell/do paradigm

### Audio Processing
- Handles Twilio mulaw format
- 8kHz sample rate
- Real-time streaming (~20ms chunks)
- Voice activity detection prevents false transcriptions

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when services unavailable
- Timeout handling for transcription
- Connection recovery
- Silence detection prevents noise transcription

### Security
- SSL/TLS for WebSocket connections
- Domain certificates for production
- No API keys required (offline transcription)

## Announcements

The system integrates with the Bonjour announcement system:

- **AUDIO_AVAILABLE**: Announced when Twilio audio ready
- **TRANSCRIPTION_COMPLETE**: Announced when speech transcribed
- **TEXT_TO_SPEECH**: Announced for TTS generation
- **AUDIO_READY**: Announced when TTS complete

## Monitoring

### Process Status
```bash
ps aux | grep -E "(twilio_stream_polymorphic|twilio_transcription_bridge|twiml_stream)"
```

### Port Status  
```bash
ss -tln | grep 808
```
Should show ports 8086 and 8088 listening.

### Service Advertisements
```bash
./go.py --advertisements
```
Should show PolymorphicTranscription and related audio services.
